  * Minimal SDK version support has been increased to 17
* Bug Fixes

  * PaperDb database was replaced with the Room database, and migration was implemented. Migration will be tried only once, and if some problem with PaperDB occurs, it will be skipped. Migration will also happen only if the number of events in the database does not exceed a thousand events.

* Features
  * Documentation improvements
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: In-app messages now initialize properly after killing the application.

## Release Notes for 2.9.3
#### April 21, 2021
* Features

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: Crash occurring when push notification is received and the notification channel provided in configuration doesn't exist.


## Release Notes for 2.9.0
#### November 20, 2020
* Features
  * Removed Firebase default init override. By default Firebase initializes before the application is started using FirebaseInitProvider. Our SDK was removing this initializer and manually creating Firebase app when the Exponea SDK was initialized, to make Firebase token tracking easier. This has caused issues in React Native, where other packages rely on the default Firebase initializer. In 2.8.3 we made a change that remembers Firebase token until Exponea SDK is initialized, so there is no point in overriding default Firebase initializer any more. 
  * Documentation improvements


## Release Notes for 2.8.3
#### October 06, 2020
* Features
  * Paper DB updated to version 2.7.1 that should fix rare crashes.
  * When Firebase is initialized before Exponea SDK, push notification token is stored until Exponea is initialized.

## Release Notes for 2.8.2
#### September 09, 2020
* Features
  * Default properties that are tracked with every event can be changed at runtime by setting `Exponea.defaultProperties` property.
  * In-app messages definitions are re-downloaded every time the customer is identified. After customer identification, the set of in-app messages available for the customer may change due to targeting.
  
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: Notification sound was played when the app notifications were disabled or the notification channel was muted. SDK now respects these settings + “Do not disturb” setting.
  * Fixed: When the SDK was initialized with activity context, this context was stored causing memory leak - the activity could not be garbage collected. The SDK now only stores application context.


## Release Notes for 2.8.1
#### August 07, 2020
* Features
  * Support for new in-app message delay and timeout fields soon to be available in Exponea web app.
  * Troubleshooting guide for [In-app messages](IN_APP_MESSAGES.md).
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: Opening a deeplink that couldn't be handled inside in-app message would cause the application to crash. Now, an error is logged.
  * Fixed: In-app message text was not correctly centered.
  * Fixed: Serialization issue in in-app messages would prevent some in-app messages from being displayed. 
  * Fixed: String mode errors with unclosed closable resources.

## Release Notes for 2.8.0
#### July 20, 2020
* Features
  * Silent push notifications support. You're now able to send background updates to your application and respond to them using `Exponea.notificationDataCallback`. Delivery of silent push notifications is tracked to Exponea backend.
  * When the application is started from a push notification, resulting session will contain UTM parameters.
  * Updated push notifications documentation and self-check mechanism to make notifications integration easier.
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: Push notification sound is no longer played in `Do not Disturb` mode


## Release Notes for 2.7.4
#### June 30, 2020
* Features
  * When initialized with instance of resumed `AppCompatActivity`, the SDK now automatically starts the session and displays in-app message (if applicable). Before, the SDK would perform these actions after next activity resume.

## Release Notes for 2.7.3
#### May 01, 2020
* Features
  * Retrieve the cookie of the current customer used for tracking by calling `Exponea.customerCookie`.
  * Improved logging for in-app messages explaining why each message should/shouldn’t be displayed.

  * Removed: Legacy banners implementation that wasn’t working properly


## Release Notes for 2.7.2
#### April 09, 2020
* Features
  * Switching projects in `anonymize()` method. If you need to switch projects, you can use `anonymize()` method to create a new customer and start fresh tracking into a new project. Please see [ANONYMIZE.md](./ANONYMIZE.md) for more information.
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: When the app was opened from a push notifications, in-app messages would not initialize properly and would not show until the app is restarted.
  * Fixed: When the SDK was initialized with the application context instead of the activity context, in-app messages would not show properly.
  * Fixed: Tracking to multiple projects. It now requires both project token and authorization token. Please see [PROJECT_MAPPING.md](./PROJECT_MAPPING.md).

* Features
  * New in-app messages - display rich messages when app starts or an event is tracked - even when offline. This SDK is fully ready for the feature when it is publicly available soon.
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: Rare internal database thread-safety related crash.

## Release Notes for 2.6.3
#### February 20, 2020
* Features
  * Updated Firebase messaging library to version 2.1.0
  * Updated minimum SDK version to 16 as recommended by Google
  * Minimal SDK version support has been increased to 16

## Release Notes for 2.6.2
#### January 10, 2020
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: Fetch recommendations functionality was reimplemented, it was incorrectly removed at one point. (see [FETCH.md](./FETCH.md))
  * Fixed: Thread safety problem in crash reporting that caused the application to crash (it would still report the crash itself).
  * Fixed: Issue with serializing Infinity, -Infinity and NaN. Double and Float variables can hold these values, but they are not part of JSON standard and Exponea doesn't support them. These values will now be reported as string values, but should be avoided. Fixes [Issue #20](https://github.com/exponea/exponea-android-sdk/issues/20).
  * Removed: Automatic payment tracking was broken and has been removed from the Exponea Android SDK. In case you're interested in this functionality let us know. Manual tracking is simplified - device properties are now automatically added. (see [PAYMENT.md](./PAYMENT.md))

## Release Notes for 2.6.1
#### December 20, 2019
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: Google Play Billing Library version > 2.0 would cause the SDK to fail to initialize properly. To mitigate the issue, SDK now only disables automatic payment tracking. Proper solution will be implemented later.

## Release Notes for 2.6.0
#### November 26, 2019
* Features
  * The SDK is now able to report the SDK-related crashes to Exponea. This helps us keep the SDK in a good shape and work on fixes as soon as possible. 
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: https://github.com/exponea/exponea-android-sdk/issues/16 - The internal database could have been initialized twice. This won't happen anymore.
  * Fixed: The SDK now correctly reports the version of the host application in the session events.

## 2.5.0
#### November 05, 2019
* Features
  * The SDK has a new protective layer for the public API as well as for the interaction with the operating system. It means that in the production setup it prefers to fail silently instead of crashing the whole application.
  * Push notification events now contain more information about campaigns and the action taken and are consistent with Exponea iOS SDK.
* Bug Fixes
  * Increased overall code quality by fixing many lint errors. This makes many warnings from the SDK disappear when the application is compiled.
  * The internal mechanisms of the SDK are now really hidden and not usable by the application. It prevents developers from using some undocumented internal part of the SDK in an inappropriate way.
  * Fixed: The periodic flushing mechanism has been fixed. Once it was started, it wouldn't stop. Now it does.
  * There are significant improvements in the unit tests of the SDK.

### 2.4.0
#### September 30, 2019
* Features
    * [App links](./APP_LINKS.md): SDK can now track app opens from App Link. Sessions that are started from App Link contain campaign data.
* Bug Fixes
    * Exponea SDK can only be initialized once. Subsequent calls to `Exponea.init` are ignored. Multiple instances of SDK cause sessions to be tracked twice.

### 2.3.3
#### August 28, 2019
* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed: Properties in the events were found to be accumulating over time. This happened always after tracking multiple events (after multiple calls of `Exponea.trackEvent()`, `Exponea.identifyCustomer()` or similar). The impacted versions are thankfully only `2.3.1` and `2.3.2`.

### 2.3.2
* `WorkManager` updated to the latest version to avoid inconsistency and crashes
* Configuration now has a token update frequency, which specifies how often should the push token be sent to Exponea (on change, on every start, daily)
