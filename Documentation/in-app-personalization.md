Through in-app personalization, Engagement provides ways to display campaigns within your mobile applications. In-app personalization can take the form of in-app messages that appear as overlays or pop-ups, or in-app content blocks that appear in line with the app's existing content.

The following two pages describe how to implement in-app messages and in-app content blocks using the SDK:

- [In-app content blocks for Android SDK](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/engagement/docs/android-sdk-in-app-content-blocks)
